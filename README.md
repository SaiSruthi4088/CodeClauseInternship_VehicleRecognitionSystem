## Aim
Develop a vehicle recognition system that can identify different types of vehicles from images or video frames.

---

## Description
This Java-based application utilizes image processing and computer vision techniques to recognize and classify vehicles. The system can detect various types of vehicles, such as cars, trucks, and motorcycles, in static images or real-time video streams.  

The application includes:
- Real-time vehicle detection
- Image-based vehicle recognition
- Proper UI for live demonstration
